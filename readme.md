## Basics of React:
Actually react is nothing but a single page of HTML (Single page application)with a root element. The root element is handled by two libraries: React and ReactDOM. A parallel DOM is maintained within the memory just like the browser does. A script is inserted in the HTML page which accesses the single element and basically what we are doing here is: rendering html though JS. That is entirely what we have don in the two projects discussed, how to create child JS elements through two libraries, ad manipulate HTML using JS. We render HTML usnig JS using the function provided by React and ReactDOM.
